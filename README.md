Project Title: Obesity Level Estimation based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition.

Our goal is to predict an individual's obesity level based on personal, dietary, and lifestyle attributes. The dataset includes features like physical characteristics, eating habits, and lifestyle factors, which can be used to classify individuals into various obesity levels.

We chose this problem because obesity is a growing global health issue, and identifying factors that contribute to obesity can help in developing prevention strategies. By working with this dataset, we aim to build a model that can classify obesity levels, potentially aiding in early intervention and awareness.
